## Introduction
[Twitter](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) is a social networking service where there are no limits or censorship at the time of sharing and posting in exchange for that liberty Twitter can be used as a tool that shows collective behaviors and significant social functions that have been studied in the fields of semiotic communication, the social construction of information and knowledge and other collective phenomena.

In this case, the main subject is to investigate the position that people have regarding "x" topic on twitter, in this way we can observe what kind of majority dominates and if such topic can even be controversial or quite talked about. 

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to analyze the slant of tweets to determine where people stand on an issue. 



## Libraries

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

- [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)

- [TextBlop](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

## Methodology

We create a program that calcultates the slant of a tweet through [TextBlop](https://medium.com/red-buffer/sentiment-analysis-let-textblob-do-all-the-work-9927d803d137), it provides us numeric values for polarity and subjectivity and it returns if the tweet is strongly postitive, weakly positive, positive, neutral, weakly negative, negative or strongly negative.

## Results

We graph if the percentages of whether a tweet was strongly postitive, weakly positive, positive, neutral, weakly negative, negative or strongly negative given a word. <br>
